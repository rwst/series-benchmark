Contains standalone programs, each testing one power series implementation.
You'll need 
https://github.com/bigdatadev/benchpress
for all of them, and the respective libraries or binaries installed, which are

* flint, http://www.flintlib.org
* libpari, from http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr
* piranha (headers), see https://github.com/bluescarni/piranha

Please see the resp. web pages for the dependencies needed for these
libraries.

The tests are manipulations of univariate series with integer exponents
and rational coefficients which is one of the main usages. The purpose
at the moment is to see if piranha's generic implementation can
compete with traditional dedicated univariate implementations.

The main test at the moment is to multiply the expansions of sin(x)
and cos(x) to various precision.
